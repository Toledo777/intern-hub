## Inspiration
Finding an internship is a challenging process, especially for students navigating interviews for the first time. Many students feel unprepared and unsure of what to expect from companies. We wanted to create **Intern Hub** to empower students by providing them with detailed, real-world insights into the interview processes at various companies. By students, for students, our platform ensures future candidates can learn from their peers' experiences and enter interviews with greater confidence.

## What It Does
**Intern Hub** is a centralized platform where students can:
- Share their interview experiences with various companies.
- Access reviews and tips from peers to prepare effectively.
- Filter reviews by company, role, or difficulty level.
- Gain insights into common interview questions and company expectations.

The platform fosters a supportive community where knowledge sharing makes the internship search journey less intimidating and more transparent.
